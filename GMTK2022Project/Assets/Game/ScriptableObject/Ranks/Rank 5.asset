  Description: These are the squad leaders of our military. They are directly responsible
    for four to five people who rely on them daily.
  PrestigeDescription: "These are the backbone of our military. They\u2019re far
    from green thanks to their extensive experience. They may not be rallying the
    troops, but they\u2019re certainly leading by example. A lot of people are counting
    on them, so treat them well."

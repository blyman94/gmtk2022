  Title: Warrant Officer 1
  Description: Warrant Officers are the journeymen of their fields. They have skill
    and talent in specific fields such as communications or engineering, but are
    still far from masters.
  PrestigeDescription: "These are the backbone of our military. They\u2019re far
    from green thanks to their extensive experience. They may not be rallying the
    troops, but they\u2019re certainly leading by example. A lot of people are counting
    on them, so treat them well."
